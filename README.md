# Foreign Language Alphabet Study Help Cards

As known as "FLASH Cards".

Feel free to try it out [here.](https://lune-stone.com/foreign-language-alphabet-study-help-cards/)

Unlike regular flash cards this application will automatically manage the adding cards and display frequency based on the learners recall rate.

The aim of the application is to provide a near instant, error free level of recall when reading foreign letters, in as short a time as possible.

## Features

* Pre-made decks
  + Japanese (Hiragana and Katakana)
  + Spanish
  + Morse Code
  + Grade 1 Brallie
* Clutter free UI
* Automatic grade and advance to the next card
* Group similar cards to be learned together
* Auto add cards based on recall rate of the current set being learned
* Auto prioritize cards with poor recall rates

## Example card

```
front: きょ
rear: kyo
```

## Evidence of Effectiveness

At the time of writing I only have my own personal anecdote to share. I had already learned Hiragana/Katakana previously, but was still struggling to read sentences because of errors in my recall on less common and similarly shaped letters. Wanting to fix that as quickly as possible I ended up writing this tool to continuously drill myself on my weakest letters. After using it over the course of about a week for perhaps as much as two hours each day (though I can't be too sure, as it's mostly a blur at this point), I found my error rate while reading was basically zero. I also never wanted to use the tool ever again in order to preserve the little sanity I had left.

I regret that I can't say if this tool can be considered appropriate for those wanting to start learning from scratch, or if they would be better off using a separate source as a primer before solidifying the knowledge with this tool. If you would like to share your own experience, I'd be glad to hear from you.

## Project Status

This project is considered largely complete and no longer in active development and will be mostly maintenance from this point forward for the foreseeable future. Feature requests are still welcome but will be less likely to be picked up by the developer compared to bugs and pull requests.
